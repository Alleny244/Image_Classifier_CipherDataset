# Image_Classifier_CipherDataset
This project is developed as a submission for TinkerHub Foundation Practical AI Bootcamp Selection Task. <br/>
A Binary Image Classifier (Deep Learning Model) that can classify images as either Ship or Truck

### Task
Create a binary classifier to classify images of ships and trucks. Deploy the model and share links to code in GitHub and the API.

### How it Works ?
The dataset required for training the ML model was obtained from CIFAR-10 dataset which was loaded from keras inbuilt datasets. <br/>
This Image classifier is built on Tensorflow framework using CNN architecture.<br/>
The  model training was carried out in Google Colab <br/>

#### Run Time Environment
python_version = "3.9" <br/>

### Libraries used
Tensorflow - The deep learning library used to train the ML model <br/>
Flask - web framework used to build API <br/>
scikit-image - for image preprocessing <br/>
